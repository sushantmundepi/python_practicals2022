PYTHON MEMORY MANAGEMENT

Some terms :

Memory Leak : Memory leak occurs when programmers create a memory in heap and forget to delete it. Memory leaks are particularly serious issues for programs like daemons and servers, which by definition, never terminate.
Garbage Collection : Garbage Collection is a process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically. Resources other than memory, such as network sockets, database handles, user interaction windows, and file and device descriptors, are not typically handled by garbage collection. 

RUN TIME MEMORY

In run time storage the data is stored in segments such as text segment(Code segment ) , data segment , stack segment and heap segment 
where :
      -->Code segment :where the compiled program sits in memory
      --> Global area : initilized data segment...store e global, static and constant data 
      -->stack segment : where parameter and local variable are allocated
      --> Heap segment : where dynamically allocated variables are allocated
How Program manage runtime memory Stack vs Heap?

STACK
the stack frame contains parameters retrun address , dynamic link , static link , return value and local varaible
-->memory use in stack is temperory and auto release 
-->fast processing/low size

HEAP
--> large pool of memory 
--> dynamic allocation
--> must be accessed through a pointer
--> large and dynamic

Memory Allocator
How Python allocates memory?

Pymalloc is a Python memory allocator, which was written by Vladimir Marangozov. It was introduced with Python 2.1 and become the default with 2.3

Python Use lots of small objects that get created and destroyed frequently

Memory usage by Python
How much python use memory for different data type?

Unlike ‘C’, Python doesn’t specify data type before assigning value to object. Thus, different data objects behave differently with python
On different systems (32 Bit, 64 Bit, Linux, Windows) python use different Byte data for the same object
